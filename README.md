# Credit Risk Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project performs Credit Risk Analysis using Python to study how customer age differs between low-risk and high-risk borrowers. By applying exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques, the project uncovers demographic patterns related to credit default risk and supports data-driven decision-making in lending.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer credit data to identify default risk patterns
- Compare age distribution across low-risk and high-risk customers
- Visualize insights using statistical plots
- Create a foundation for future predictive modeling

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is credit_risk_data_1200_rows.csv. It contains customer-level data including age and a default risk indicator, where 0 represents low risk and 1 represents high risk.

## Tools and Technologies
Python is used as the primary programming language. Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, while Matplotlib is used for data visualization.

## Analysis and Visualization
A boxplot is created to compare the age distribution of customers across default risk categories. This visualization highlights median age differences, variability in age, and the presence of outliers, helping to clearly understand demographic patterns associated with credit risk.

## How to Run the Project
Install the required libraries using pip install pandas matplotlib and then run the script using python credit_risk_analysis.py.

## Key Insights
The analysis shows noticeable differences in age distribution between low-risk and high-risk customers. Certain age groups exhibit higher variability in default risk, demonstrating the importance of demographic analysis in credit risk assessment.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and visualization can generate meaningful insights in credit risk analysis and serve as a strong base for advanced techniques such as machine learning-based credit scoring models.
